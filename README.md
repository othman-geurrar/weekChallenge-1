# Project Title

The project is a simple blog post application built using Node.js. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and focuses on creating and reading blog posts.

Models: The post.js file in the models folder defines the structure of a blog post and functions to interact with a JSON file. This includes functions for reading and writing to the JSON file, such as getAllPosts, createPost, etc.

Views: As this is a backend-focused project, views are not utilized. However, in a full MVC application, this would be where templates and rendering are managed.

Controllers: The postController.js file in the controllers folder handles the logic for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It uses the functions defined in the post.js model to interact with the data.

Routes: The postRoutes.js file in the routes folder defines the routes for the application and uses Express Router. These routes map to the functions in the postController.js file.

The application allows users to create new blog posts and read existing ones. Each blog post includes a title, author, date, content, and tags. The content of a blog post is an array of paragraphs, and tags are an array of strings.

This project provides a solid foundation for a more complex blog application. Future enhancements could include adding user authentication, allowing users to update and delete posts, and adding a front-end to display the posts in a user-friendly format.

I hope this gives you a good overview of the project! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
